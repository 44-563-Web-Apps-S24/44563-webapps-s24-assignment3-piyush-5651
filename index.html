    <h2>Pappu Dhaba Restaurant and Hotel</h2>
    <p>I like this restaurant because me and my friends used to go there and spent good time. The food was very
        delicious and wide range of options are available. The <strong>quantity of the food</strong> was good enough for
        a big group. The <strong>ambiance of restaurant is really amazing</strong> during the rainy season.</p>
