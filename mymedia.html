    <p>I'm big fan of anime my favorite anime is One Piece It's a pirate store about finding a big treasure. In the
        complete Luffy the led character made a lots of friends and travelled complete Grand Line. This series first
        show aired in August 1999 and It is still in run. This was Number one show for couple of years and there is only
        one write for this anime.</p>

    <h1>Piyush Jain</h1>

    <p>"Rockstar" follows the journey of a young musician who evolves from a dreamer to a tormented artist grappling
        with fame, love, and loss. Directed by Imtiaz Ali, the film explores themes of music, heartbreak, and
        self-discovery, immersing audiences into the tumultuous yet mesmerizing world of its protagonist. With
        soul-stirring performances and a poignant narrative, "Rockstar" stands as a testament to the brilliance of
        storytelling in Indian cinema.</p>
